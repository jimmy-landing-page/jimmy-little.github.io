### About jimmylittle.com

This site is completely written, researched, and updated by Jimmy Little.  It is meant to be a personal and professional outlet for information about me, what I'm interested in, and what I'm doing.

### Content

Everything here is written by me.  If I quote another site or video, it is always attributed and linked to.  Don't steal content.  That makes you an unproductive douche.

### Workflow
Huge changes.  Coming Soon.
~~I've drastically changed my workflow in the last couple years.  I'm going to post about it at some point, but a quick overview -

I write in plain text with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) formatting.  I use TextWrangler on my Mac and [Drafts](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&uo=6&at=1001l3C5%22%20target=%22itunes_store) or [Editorial](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/editorial/id673907758?mt=8) on my iOS devices.  I keep everything in sync on Dropbox.  When it's time to post, I copy and paste into a Markdown block on Squarespace.  I'd love for Squarespace to give me a way to upload arbitrary image files so I can add the URLs to my Markdown files and be done, but for now I have to log into a web browser and use Squarespace's (admittedly awesome) interface for adding images.~~


### Images

Most of the images on this site are linked versions of the original.  If it's an Apple post, I link an image from Apple's site.  Or, I use [SmugMug](htp://www.smugmug.com), [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/), or Google Image search tools to find royalty free and creative commons images.  Or I use [iStockPhoto](http://www.istockphoto.com/index.php).  Don't just Google for images and use them.  That's stealing.  Thieves are dicks.  

### Web Standards

If the site doesn’t display properly it's because you are not using a standards-compliant browser. To properly display the site, switch to a modern, standards-compliant browser like Safari, Chrome, or Firefox.  Don't e-mail me that the site looks like shit with Internet Explorer, there's nothing I can do about that.  If you are using a grown-up web browser and have an issue, please [let me know](http://jimmylittle.com/contact).

### Support the Site

[Support the site by shopping at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fyourstore%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dpd_irl_gw%26signIn%3D1&tag=jimmlitt-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957)

By shopping through the Amazon link on this page, a small percentage of the purchases you make comes back to me.  I use the income to pay for this site.  Any income above and beyond that is donated to animal charities.  Also, most of the software and products I link to on this site use affiliate links.  If you click on a link and buy something through iTunes, the App Store, or Amazon, I will get a small percentage of the purchase price back from Apple or Amazon, and it costs you nothing.  That's a damn good deal for everyone.
