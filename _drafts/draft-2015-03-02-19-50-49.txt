#New Tricks

They say you can't teach an old dog new tricks.  "They" is wrong.  

Isabelle (better known publicly as The Bug or [@theBugDog](http://www.twitter.com/theBugDog), is about to start some new training at the ripe old age of eleven and three-quarters.  It's time to quite literally teach some new skills to an aging Boston Terrier. 

After a couple of bad ear infections and some allergy issues, The Bug is now pretty much deaf. She no longer runs to the kitchen at the sound of a crinkly bag opening. She no longer runs to the foyer with her favorite skunk toy (which is also eleven years old) to greet whomever opened the door. Now, she can be asleep on the rug by the front door and get bumped in the butt because she doesn't hear the door open. Instead of frustrating her humans by ignoring simple commands, she just frustrates us by not hearing them to begin with. Dog whistles don't even work. 

So, we're teaching (and learning) a new set of tricks. Hand signals are the only option, so that's what's next. We'll be spending some time learning standard hand signals ,which I used to know back when The Bug was in agility classes when we were both much younger. Once we get them down, we'll start teaching Isabelle. 

The good news is, after a couple days the heavy drugs from the latest ear infection wore off, and The Bug is mostly back to normal, except for the whole deafness thing. 

She doesn't seem to miss hearing at all, and she still runs around the house carrying that old skunk begging for a game of tug-of-war. She's compensating by actually looking at us a lot more, and tends to stay in the same room as us more than she used to.  

Off to buy a crap-ton of treats. We have a lot of learnin' to do.
