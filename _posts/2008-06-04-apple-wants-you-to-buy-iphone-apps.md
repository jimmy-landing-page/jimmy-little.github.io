<div data-src="v5">
  <p>
    <a href="http://www.apple.com/backtoschool/index.html?CID=WWW-NAUS-BTS20080530-OSA9M" target="_blank"><img src="http://images.apple.com/home/2008/images/promo_bts20080609.jpg" alt="back to Apple" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="180" height="118" align="left" /></a> Apple is going to release iPhone 2.0 software and open the App store soon.&nbsp; Very soon.&nbsp; Rumor has it that it will be June 9th at WWDC, and there's now one more reason to believe it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Apple's Back-To-School promotion, usually held in late summer, offers a free iPod Nano to students buying a laptop or desktop Mac.&nbsp; This year, the promotion starts in early June, and includes the iPod Touch as one of the freebies.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Why is this important?&nbsp; Because the iPod Touch can run the same software that the iPhone can.&nbsp; Steve Jobs and Apple are willing to take the initial hit of giving away the low-end 8GB iPod Touch in order to sell, sell, sell more apps this summer.&nbsp; It's looking like Jobs will announce iPhone 2.0 software, iPod Touch 2.0 software, and open the app store as part of his keynote address at WWDC.&nbsp; There's also rumors of new 3G iPhone hardware, but I think ol' Steve will save that for its own event.&nbsp; Maybe June 23, on iPhone's 1st birthday?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    That's my take, anyway. &nbsp;&nbsp;
