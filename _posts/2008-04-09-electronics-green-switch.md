  Putting occasional electronic equipment, like DVD players, VCR&#8217;s, and Game Consoles on a separate power <a href="http://s3.media.squarespace.com/production/453260/5085149/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/didyouknow.png"><img class="alignleft alignnone size-medium wp-image-101" style="border: 0pt none; margin: 10px; float: left;" title="didyouknow" src="http://s3.media.squarespace.com/production/453260/5085149/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/07/didyouknow.png" alt="" width="132" height="62" /></a>switch can save HUNDREDS of dollars a year on your electric bill?  Most equipment, including TV&#8217;s, DVR&#8217;s, DVD players, VCR&#8217;s, amps, and even microwaves and coffee makers suck power 24/7.  They&#8217;re called Vampires for a reason.  If you add a &#8220;green switch&#8221; to your entertainment center, to turn off everything but your DVR (digital video recorder, or TiVo), you can save a ton of money, and a ton of pollution, each year.  It can be as simple as a separate power strip for the stuff you leave on and the stuff you turn off.  Leave that DVR on, though.  It won&#8217;t record without power.  Baby steps, people.  Baby steps.
