  <img src="images/articles/didyouknow.png" alt="did you know?" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="53" align="left" />every bit of plastic ever created, EVER, is still on the planet?&nbsp; That's over 100 billion tons of it.&nbsp; About 15% is recycled, and the rest is in the landfills and oceans.&nbsp; Even biodegradable plastic takes years to dissolve, and that's under ideal conditions.&nbsp; Under a landfill or under water, where there is no oxygen or sunlight, the plastic will take millions of years to break down.&nbsp; MILLIONS.&nbsp;
