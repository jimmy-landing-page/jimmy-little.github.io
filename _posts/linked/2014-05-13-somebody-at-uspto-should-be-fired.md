On March 18, 2014 the US Patent and Trademark Office officially jumped the shark.

Amazon has [patented](http://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=08676045&idkey=NONE&_ga=1.178291236.1205361971.1397085400) photography against a white background. 

Yep. Amazon owns white now. 


The application covers 

>a front light source aimed at a background, an image capture position located between the background and the front light source, an elevated platform positioned between the image capture position and the background, and at least one rear light source

Sound technical?  Don't worry.  They provided a technical drawing.
