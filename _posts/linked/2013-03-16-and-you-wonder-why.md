Mike Woodward, President of HTC North America, <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/htc-interview-about-samsung-galaxy-s4-2013-3" target="_blank">speaking about the Samsung Galaxy S4</a>:
  
    
>We're pleased to see no innovation in the design itself
    

This would explain why HTC has been losing money and market share hand over fist the last few years.  Innovation is not changing the way a device looks.  It's changing the way people use it.  
  
  
iPhones have looked basically the same since 2007, but every year Apple changes the way people can use them.  Samsung is doing the same with the Galaxy line, and I think it's a good move.
