The DOJ has vacated their order for Apple to unlock the San Bernardino iPhone.  They were always on shaky legal ground, and were flat out lying about the technicalities of it all.  They now say they've found a way to unlock the phone without compelling a private business to write software for the government.

This isn't over by anyone's estimation, but the conversation can slow down and be reasonable now, at least.
