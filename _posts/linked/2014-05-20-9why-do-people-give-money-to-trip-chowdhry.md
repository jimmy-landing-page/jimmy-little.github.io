From a [CNBC story](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101509203) on March 20, 2014:

> "They only have 60 days left to either come up with something or they will disappear," said Trip Chowdhry, managing director at Global Equities Research.

  Cut to 60 days later...

Chowdhry is supposed to be a financial analyst in the tech sector, but he is [constantly wrong. ](http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2013/07/07/apple-analyst-trip-chowdhry/)  

 

On a funny aside, as I was typing this post on my iPad, autocorrect changed "Chowdhry" to "chowderhead" twice. Then, it learned it was wrong and stopped. 

 

Unlike Chowdhry.
